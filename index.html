                        Hey there, I'm a student at the University of Missouri currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's
                        of Computer Science degree in parallel (threading pun <i>definitely</i> intended). Ever since discovering the field in my freshman
                        year, I have found a passion for all things tech. I have used my time in school to gain as much experience
                        as possible through research, side projects, school clubs, and internships. From web development to
                        image processing, mobile development to machine learning, database systems to cloud
                        architecture, I have done a little bit of everything. I am a very versatile, passionate engineer who is
                        always up to learn something new. My latest learning has been TensorFlow's high level APIs for use with
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP). There's lots more to know about me, if you have any questions feel free to
                        <a href="#contact">reach out</a> to me.

                            This was my final project for Object Oriented Design. The goal of the project was to compare two
                            object-oriented programming languages in dozens of different facets. This project compares two
                            newer languages: Swift and Kotlin. This project was interesting because these are the flagship languages
                            now for iOS and Android development.

                            This was my final project for Object Oriented Programming I. I found a list of 120,000
                            common English words off the internet, then wrote a script that cleaned the data,
                            only kept words between 4 and 12 characters, and deleted proper nouns. The game then
                            randomly selects a word for the game, and also has the ability for users to login and
                            save their games locally.
